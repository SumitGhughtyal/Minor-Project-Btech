# üî¨ Explainable AI for Network Anomaly Detection

This project provides an interactive web application for detecting and explaining anomalies in network traffic data. It uses an **Isolation Forest** model for detection and **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to provide human-readable explanations for each detected anomaly.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Anomaly Detection**: Employs an unsupervised Isolation Forest algorithm to identify unusual network flows.
- **Explainability (XAI)**: Integrates SHAP to show which network features (e.g., port, packet size, duration) contributed most to an anomaly score.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web interface.
- **Reproducible**: Includes a requirements file and data download script for easy setup.
